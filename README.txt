Forms, Tables and Pictures INTEGRATED.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

1. Incorporated a Form into the website footer for newsletter subscription. Checkout artist.html to check it but will be added to all webpages.

2. Tables used in pages:
	-> artist.html
	-> artist_profile.html

3. Images added overall.
	-> artist.html
	-> artist_profile.html
	images only added as placeholders since this page serves as a generic template that will be generated dynamically for each artist so dont need to make one for each artist. 

	More picture work done on:
	-> artwork.html
	-> painting.html
